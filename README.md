## Project Overview
This project aims to classify lung images into three classes for early lung cancer detection. The workflow involves data preprocessing, visualization, and deep learning model training.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Lung cancer dataset with 12,000 images in three classes.
- **Classes**: Categories represent various stages/types related to lung cancer.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps included:
- Resizing images for input consistency.
- Normalizing pixel values.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Data Visualization
Key visualizations included class distributions and sample images per class to gain insights into the dataset.

```python
def display_images(generator, num_images=4):
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=num_images, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 10))
    axs = axs.flatten()

    for i in range(num_images):
        img, label = next(generator)
        axs[2*i].imshow(img[0])
        axs[2*i].set_title('Original Image')
        axs[2*i].axis('off')

        axs[2*i+1].imshow(img[0])
        axs[2*i+1].set_title('Augmented Image')
        axs[2*i+1].axis('off')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Display original and augmented images for training data
display_images(train_generator)

# Display original and augmented images for validation data
display_images(validation_generator)
```

## Model Definition
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was defined to classify the lung images effectively. The model architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for final classification.

## Model Training
The model was trained using the following settings:
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: (Specify your epochs)
- **Batch Size**: (Specify your batch size)

## Results
The model achieved a **99% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating a highly effective lung cancer classification performance.

## Future Work
- Enhance model robustness through data augmentation.
- Experiment with different CNN architectures for improved performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a successful application of deep learning for lung cancer prediction with high accuracy, showcasing the potential for aiding early detection.
